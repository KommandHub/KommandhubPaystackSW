![Shopware Paystack Logo](src/Resources/config/shopware.png)

A production-grade **Shopware 6 payment plugin** that integrates the **[Paystack](https://paystack.com)** payment gateway, enabling merchants across Africa to accept secure online payments through cards, bank transfers, USSD, and mobile money.

Developed by [Kommandhub Limited](https://kommandhub.com).

This document is the technical reference for developers **contributing to** the plugin. If you only want to install and configure it on a live shop, the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuration](#configuration) sections are enough.

## Project Overview

The plugin adds Paystack as a native Shopware 6 payment method. It handles the full payment lifecycle:

1. **Initialize** a Paystack transaction and redirect the customer to Paystack's hosted checkout.
2. **Finalize** the payment on return by verifying the transaction against the Paystack API — matching **status, amount, and currency** before the order is marked paid.
3. **Reconcile** payments asynchronously via signed webhooks (for cases where the customer never returns from the redirect).
4. **Refund** orders (full or partial) from the Administration, guarded by a dedicated permission and a server-side over-refund check.

It also provides customer bank-account verification (via Paystack's account-resolution endpoint) and correct money handling for the currencies Paystack supports, including zero-decimal (e.g. XOF, RWF) and three-decimal (e.g. KWD) currencies.

> The plugin does **not** create currencies or languages in your shop. Amounts are converted correctly for whichever currency an order uses; adding a currency (e.g. XOF) or a language to Shopware remains a normal shop configuration step.

---

## Key Features

- Native Shopware 6 payment method with Paystack hosted checkout.
- Payment verification that validates **status + amount + currency** (the return reference is attacker-controllable, so all three are checked).
- Asynchronous reconciliation through signed webhooks: `charge.success`, `refund.pending`, `refund.processed`.
- Full and partial refunds from the order detail page, with a **server-side over-refund cap**.
- A dedicated **`paystack.refund`** admin permission, assignable to roles (depends on the order editor permission).
- Customer bank-account verification in the account area.
- Correct amount handling for every currency Paystack supports, including 0-decimal (e.g. XOF, RWF) and 3-decimal (e.g. KWD) currencies — amounts always cross the Paystack boundary in the right minor unit.
- Plugin interface translated into English, German and French (administration + storefront).
- Optional Paystack split payments (subaccount / charges bearer).
- Configurable, level-filtered logging with a sandbox/live mode toggle.

---

## Supported Payment Channels

Availability depends on your Paystack account and configuration:

- Debit & credit cards
- Bank transfers
- USSD
- QR codes
- Mobile money (Ghana, Kenya, and others)

---

## Architecture Overview

The plugin uses a **feature-first** layout that mirrors Shopware's own plugins (for example, SwagPayPal). Each top-level directory under `src/` is a bounded feature; inside it, code is organized into flat, Symfony-idiomatic folders (`Service`, `Subscriber`, `Handler`, `Struct`, `Event`, `Enum`, `Controller`). There is no `Application/Domain/Infrastructure` layering — a top-level module *is* the boundary, and every class has one obvious home.

**Guiding principles**

- Shopware entry points (payment handler, controllers, subscribers) stay thin and delegate to services.
- A change stays inside its feature module; cross-module access goes through a service, not by deep-linking another module's internals.
- New Paystack API calls go through a typed `Client/Resource/` class, never raw HTTP.
- Money is always in **minor units** at the Paystack boundary and converted only through `PaystackCurrencyHelper`.

**Payment flow**

```text
Customer selects Paystack
        │
        ▼
PaymentProcessor.initialize()  ──►  Paystack transaction created, reference persisted
        │
        ▼
Redirect to Paystack hosted checkout
        │
        ▼
Customer pays ──► redirect back ──► FinalizeProcessor.verify()
        │                                   (status == success AND amount AND currency match)
        ▼
Order transaction marked "paid"

If the customer never returns, the `charge.success` webhook reconciles the order
using the reference stored at initialize time (idempotent: it no-ops if already paid).
```

**Refund flow**

```text
Admin opens the order → Paystack tab → Refund
        │  (client gate: paystack.refund permission + refundable balance)
        ▼
RefundController.refund()  ──►  server gate: _acl paystack.refund, min & max (over-refund) checks
        │
        ▼
Paystack refund created ──► refund.pending / refund.processed webhooks update Shopware refund records
```

> Assets under `Resources/public/` and `Resources/app/storefront/dist/` are **generated**. Never hand-edit them — change the source in `Resources/app/**/src/` and rebuild.

---

## System Requirements

- **Shopware**: `~6.6.0` or `~6.7.0`
- **PHP**: `8.2+`
- **Composer**: 2.x
- **Paystack account**: <https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/signup>
- **For local development**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **For admin/storefront asset builds**: Node.js (provided inside the dev container)

---

## Installation

### Via Composer (recommended)

```bash
composer require kommandhub/paystack-sw
bin/console plugin:refresh
bin/console plugin:install --activate KommandhubPaystackSW
bin/console cache:clear
```

### Manual upload

1. Build a ZIP containing at least `src/` and `composer.json`.
2. In the Administration, go to **Extensions → My Extensions → Upload Extension**.
3. Install and activate **Paystack Payment**.

After installation, assign the **Paystack Payment** method to your sales channel under **Settings → Shop → Payment Methods**.

---

## Local Development Setup

The repository ships a Docker Compose stack based on [`dockware`](https://dockware.io) that mounts this plugin into a full Shopware install.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url> KommandhubPaystackSW
cd KommandhubPaystackSW

# 2. Start the stack (builds the container and prepares the shop)
make up

# 3. Install and activate the plugin inside the container
make shell
bin/console plugin:refresh
bin/console plugin:install --activate KommandhubPaystackSW
bin/console cache:clear
exit
```

The plugin directory is mounted at `/var/www/html/custom/static-plugins/KommandhubPaystackSW`; `.git/`, `node_modules/`, and `vendor/` are excluded from the mount. Changes to source files on the host are reflected immediately in the container.

Default dockware credentials:

- **Admin**: user `admin`, password `shopware`
- **Database**: user `root`, password `root`, database `shopware`

---

## Docker & Docker Compose

The stack is defined in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and built from
a small [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile):

- **Base image**: `dockware/shopware:6.7.8.0`
- **Added tooling**: [`shopware-cli`](https://sw-cli.fos.gg/) — the static binary
  is copied from the upstream `shopware/shopware-cli:bin` image (latest stable,
  ~50 MB, multi-arch), so no package manager or cleanup is involved. The build
  runs `shopware-cli --version` so a broken install fails the image build rather
  than the first `make validate-plugin`. Pin it for a reproducible build by
  passing `--build-arg SHOPWARE_CLI_IMAGE=shopware/shopware-cli:bin@sha256:<digest>`.
- **Container**: `kommandhub-paystack-plugin`
- **PHP**: 8.3 (`XDEBUG_ENABLED` toggle available)
- **Persistent volume**: `database` (MySQL data)

```bash
make up        # build + start + prepare
make down      # stop and REMOVE volumes (wipes the database)
make shell     # open a shell in the container
```

> **No host port is published by default.** To reach the Administration from your browser, add a mapping such as `ports: ["80:80"]` to the `shopware` service and reload with `docker compose up -d`. Do **not** use `make restart` for this — it runs `docker compose down -v`, which deletes the database volume and the installed shop.

---

## Makefile Commands

All targets run the underlying tools inside the running container.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make up` | Build, start, and prepare the Shopware container |
| `make down` | Stop the container and remove volumes (wipes the DB) |
| `make build` | Rebuild the container image |
| `make restart` | `down` + `up` (wipes the DB) |
| `make shell` | Open a bash shell in the container |
| `make plugin-list` | List installed plugins |
| `make test` | Run PHPUnit. Filter with `make test FILTER="--filter SomeTest"` |
| `make test-coverage` | Run PHPUnit with a text coverage report |
| `make cs` | PHP-CS-Fixer dry run (no changes) |
| `make cs-fix` | PHP-CS-Fixer, applying fixes |
| `make analyse` | PHPStan static analysis on `src/` |
| `make fixture-load` | Load test fixtures |
| `make resync` | Sync the test config into the shop root |
| `make prepare` | Full project preparation (run by `make up`) |
| `make validate-plugin` | Validate the plugin with `shopware-cli` (`--full --store-compliance`) |
| `make cli` | Run any `shopware-cli` command: `make cli ARGS="extension get-version ."` |
| `make changelog` | Render `CHANGELOG.md` as the Shopware Store would display it |
| `make zip` | Build a distributable plugin zip into `build/` |

`shopware-cli` ships inside the container image (see [Docker & Docker Compose](#docker--docker-compose)), so these run against the same PHP version and installed Shopware as the tests — not whatever is on the host. No local install is required.

**Before committing, run:**

```bash
make cs-fix && make analyse && make test
```

---

## Configuration Options

Configure the plugin under **Extensions → My Extensions → Paystack → Configuration**. Options are stored in Shopware's system configuration under the `KommandhubPaystackSW.config.*` domain and read through `Setting\Service\Config`.

| Key | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiSecretKey` | password | Live secret key (`sk_live_...`) |
| `enableSandbox` | bool | Use the sandbox/test key instead of live |
| `apiSecretKeySandbox` | password | Test secret key (`sk_test_...`) |
| `enableSplitPayment` | bool | Enable Paystack split payments |
| `subaccountCode` | text | Split payment subaccount code |
| `splitCode` | text | Split payment split code |
| `splitPaymentTransactionCharge` | int | Flat transaction charge for split payments |
| `paystackChargesBearer` | select | Who bears fees: Account (merchant) or Subaccount |
| `metaData` | multi-select | Extra order/customer data sent to Paystack |
| `collectBankData` | bool | Collect customer bank data in the account area |
| `showBvnField` | bool | Show the BVN field |
| `requireBvn` | bool | Make the BVN field required |
| `refundEnabled` | bool | Allow refunds from the Administration |
| `minimumRefundAmount` | int | Minimum refund amount, in minor units |
| `enableDebugging` | bool | Enable verbose logging |
| `logLevels` | multi-select | PSR-3 levels to log when debugging is enabled |

> Secret keys are stored in Shopware's system configuration, never in code. There is no public key setting — Paystack initialization is server-to-server using the secret key.

---

## Build & Asset Compilation

PHP has no build step beyond `composer install`. Frontend assets do, and their compiled output is committed to the repository.

**Administration (Vue → Vite)**, output to `Resources/public/administration/`:

```bash
make shell
./bin/build-administration.sh
```

**Storefront**, output to `Resources/app/storefront/dist/`:

```bash
make shell
./bin/build-storefront.sh
```

Rebuild the relevant bundle whenever you change source under `Resources/app/administration/src/` or `Resources/app/storefront/src/`, and commit the regenerated assets together with the source. Keeping route names, service IDs, and custom-field keys stable means most PHP changes require **no** asset rebuild.

---

## Testing

Tests live under `tests/` and mirror `src/`. Each behavior change should ship with a test.

```bash
make test                              # full suite
make test FILTER="--filter RefundControllerTest"
make test-coverage                     # text coverage report
```

- **Unit tests** (`tests/Unit/`) use plain `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` with mocks and require no Shopware kernel. These run in CI.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/Integration/`) exercise controllers and the plugin lifecycle. Those tagged `#[Group('kernel')]` need a booted Shopware kernel and database, so they run locally via `make test` rather than in the lightweight CI job.
- **End-to-end**: there is no automated E2E suite yet. The payment, refund and webhook flows are validated manually against a running shop with a Paystack **test** key. Automating this is on the [roadmap](#roadmap).

Pure business logic in the admin (`Resources/app/administration/src/service/refund-calculator.js`) has a companion Jest-style spec (`refund-calculator.spec.js`) for a full Shopware admin test runner.

---

## Code Quality

| Tool | Command | Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHPStan (level 9) | `make analyse` | `phpstan.dist.neon` |
| PHP-CS-Fixer | `make cs` / `make cs-fix` | `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` |
| PHPUnit | `make test` | `phpunit.dist.xml` |

CI enforces PHP lint, PHPStan, code style, unit + mockable integration tests, and a 100% line-coverage threshold. Kernel-dependent tests are excluded from CI.

---

## Data Handling

The plugin ships **no schema migrations** — it does not alter the database schema. All setup is performed through Shopware's plugin lifecycle by dedicated installers:

- **Payment method**: created and kept in sync by `Installer\PaymentMethodInstaller`.
- **Custom fields** (Paystack reference, amount, currency, fee, etc.): created by `Installer\CustomFieldsInstaller` during install/update.

These run on `install()`/`update()` and are reverted appropriately on uninstall (custom fields are removed only when the user does not keep plugin data).

> The plugin's `update()` lifecycle hook re-runs the installers, which migrates the stored payment-method `handlerIdentifier` if the handler class moves between versions. Without this, a plugin **update** (as opposed to a fresh install) would leave a dangling handler identifier and break checkout.

---

## Logging & Debugging

Logging goes through `Logging\ConfigurableLogger`, wired to the `paystack_channel` Monolog channel (writes to `var/log/`).

- Set `enableDebugging` and pick `logLevels` to control verbose output.
- **Error, critical, alert, and emergency messages are always written**, regardless of the debugging toggle, so production keeps a trail of failures (webhook signature rejections, verification/refund errors).
- Enable Xdebug in the container by setting `XDEBUG_ENABLED=1` in `docker-compose.yml` and restarting.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Webhook authenticity**: `WebhookSignatureValidator` verifies the `x-paystack-signature` HMAC over the raw request body using `hash_equals` (timing-safe) and rejects missing signatures or a missing secret.
- **Payment verification**: an order is marked paid only when the verified transaction matches **status AND amount AND currency**. The return `reference` comes from an attacker-controllable callback, so it is never trusted on its own.
- **Refund authorization**: the refund endpoint requires the dedicated `paystack.refund` privilege (route `_acl`), and the admin action is gated by the same permission.
- **Over-refund protection**: the server recomputes the refundable balance (captures/transaction total minus completed and in-progress refunds) and rejects amounts above it and below the configured minimum. The client-side bound is a UX aid only.
- **Secrets**: API keys live in Shopware's system configuration, not in the codebase or in URLs.
- **Money handling**: amounts cross the Paystack boundary in minor units via `PaystackCurrencyHelper`, which knows per-currency decimals — never multiply by 100 inline.

---

## Performance Considerations

- Order/transaction reads use targeted DAL criteria with only the associations they need.
- The admin detail view guards against concurrent capture/refund loads and loads plugin configuration reactively rather than on a fixed lifecycle tick.
- Refund math is a pure, memoizable computation isolated in `refund-calculator.js`.

---

## Deployment

1. Ship the plugin via Composer (`composer require kommandhub/paystack-sw`) or an Administration upload.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   bin/console plugin:refresh
   bin/console plugin:update KommandhubPaystackSW   # migrates handler identifier + custom fields
   bin/console cache:clear
   ```
3. Ensure compiled Administration and Storefront assets are built and committed as part of the release.
4. Configure live secret keys and disable sandbox mode.
5. Grant the **Paystack → Process Paystack refunds** permission to the roles that should be able to issue refunds (the built-in admin role already has all privileges).

Validate a release build for the Shopware Store from inside the container, where
`shopware-cli` runs against the installed Shopware and full vendor tree:

```bash
make validate-plugin
# equivalently: make cli ARGS="extension validate . --full --store-compliance"
```

Running the same command against a host-only `shopware-cli` reports false
positives (see the PHPStan note under [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)) —
the container has the dependencies it needs to resolve Shopware's classes.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/php.yml`) runs on pushes to `main`/`develop` and on pull requests:

1. Validate `composer.json`.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Lint all PHP files.
4. PHPStan (level 9).
5. PHP-CS-Fixer (dry run).
6. PHPUnit unit tests with clover coverage.
7. Enforce a minimum coverage threshold (85%) via `coverage-check`.

Integration tests are excluded from this job because they need a booted Shopware kernel; run them locally with `make test`.

---

## Version Compatibility

| Plugin | Shopware | PHP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.9.0-beta.x` | 6.6 and 6.7 | 8.2+ |

A single plugin release supports both Shopware 6.6 and 6.7 (`shopware/core: ~6.6.0 || ~6.7.0`).

> **Pre-1.0 status:** the plugin is on a `0.x` version while it completes sandbox/staging validation (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)). Namespaces and the public API may still change before `1.0.0`. Once testing is complete and all critical issues are resolved, this will be promoted to `1.0.0` and submitted to the Shopware Store.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Order status not updating after payment**
- Confirm the webhook endpoint is reachable from Paystack and the secret key matches the mode (test vs live).
- Check `var/log/` for verification or signature errors.

**Plugin not visible in the Administration**
```bash
bin/console plugin:refresh
```

**Stale Administration UI or DI errors after changes**
```bash
bin/console cache:clear
```

**Refund action not shown**
- Ensure `refundEnabled` is on, the role has the `paystack.refund` permission, and the transaction still has a refundable balance.

**PHPStan can't find `Shopware\Storefront\...` during `shopware-cli` validation**
- `shopware/storefront` must be declared in `require` (it is). Do not point `scanDirectories` at the host's `vendor/` — let Composer install and autoload it.

---

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch off `develop`.
2. Keep changes inside the relevant feature module; reach across modules through services.
3. Add or update tests alongside behavior changes (mirror the `src/` path under `tests/`).
4. Rebuild admin/storefront assets if you touched their source, and commit the output.
5. Run the full local gate before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   make cs-fix && make analyse && make test
   ```
6. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, …).
7. Open a pull request against `develop`.

Please also read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the module boundaries and project-specific conventions.

---

## Coding Standards

- **PHP style**: PSR-12, enforced by PHP-CS-Fixer (`.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`).
- **Static analysis**: PHPStan level 9 must pass with no new errors.
- **Architecture**: feature-first modules; one obvious home per class; thin Shopware entry points delegating to services.
- **Paystack API**: add new calls as typed classes under `Client/Resource/`, never as raw HTTP.
- **Money**: always convert through `Util\PaystackCurrencyHelper`; amounts are minor units at the Paystack boundary.
- **Custom-field keys**: defined only in `Util\PaystackConstants` (`paystack_reference` is the webhook lookup key).
- **Dependency injection**: services are autowired via the `../../*` glob in `services.yml`. Symfony does not auto-alias an interface to its single implementation — when you add a constructor-injected `*Interface`, add an explicit `alias:` entry.

---

## Roadmap

- Complete the migration of Administration components to the Meteor Component Library (`sw-*` → `mt-*`), including data grids and modals.
- Make the storefront bank-verification feature optional for headless setups (decouple from `StorefrontController`).
- Trim unused Paystack API resource classes to the endpoints the plugin actually uses.
- Add automated end-to-end coverage. Planned in layers, cheapest first:
  1. **Paystack sandbox contract tests** — call the real API with an `sk_test_` key to prove the client matches Paystack's contract and that amounts survive the round trip in minor units.
  2. **Webhook endpoint tests** — POST signed/unsigned payloads over HTTP (Paystack signs with HMAC-SHA512 of the raw body using the secret key, in `x-paystack-signature`).
  3. **Browser tests** — storefront checkout through Paystack's hosted page and the Administration refund flow.
  Notes for whoever picks this up: gate the suite behind an env var so it skips by default, refuse to run against a live key, exclude it from CI, and remember that real webhook delivery needs a public tunnel **and** the tunnel hostname registered as a Shopware sales-channel domain (otherwise Shopware answers `400` before the controller runs).
